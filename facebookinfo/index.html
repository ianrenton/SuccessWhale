    <h2>Discontinuation of Facebook Support</h2>

    <h2>What happened?</h2>
    <p>On April 30th 2015, Facebook started enforcing a manual review process whereby each application must be individually reviewed for each permission it requests. Some permissions that are vital for SuccessWhale, such as "read_stream", are no longer granted to third-party applications. You can <a href="http://blog.ianrenton.com/the-end-of-the-road-for-successwhales-facebook-support/">read about the implications on my blog</a>.</p>
    <h2>What does this mean for SuccessWhale?</h2>
    <p>Reading Facebook feeds in SuccessWhale will no longer work. Unfortunately there seems to be nothing we can do about this.</p>
    <h2>Is there a work-around?</h2>
    <p>There is, but you're not going to like it. Facebook automatically allows all permissions if the user requesting them is the owner of the application. This means that if you run your own copy of SuccessWhale &mdash; including the API and database &mdash; then Facebook will work as intended for you (and only you).</p>
